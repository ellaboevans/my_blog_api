## Overview

The Blog API is designed to provide a simple and efficient solution for managing blog posts. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts using standard HTTP methods. The API is built with Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, and uses MongoDB as the database for storing blog post data.

## Installation

To run the Blog API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ellaboevans/my_blog_api`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my_blog_api`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up the MongoDB connection by providing the connection URL in a `.env` file or directly in the configuration.
5. Start the server: `npm start`

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API by sending HTTP requests to the defined endpoints. You can use tools like cURL or Postman to make requests and test the functionality of the API. Refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section below for detailed information on each endpoint.

- `GET /api/posts` - Retrieve all blog posts.
